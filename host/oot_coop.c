/* (hookshot) Co-op progress sync, the game side (oot_coop.h), for the supported build e0f3ccfa.

   The flag database is the game's GameDataMgr (**0x84c9e180, as host/hos_main.c's debug tools reach it): typed
   containers of 0x60 bytes from +8: Bool at +0x008, Int at +0x0c8, UInt at +0x788. A container holds its entry count
   (+0x08), entries (+0x10), an open-addressing table of {u32 hash, u32 entry} slots probed from hash % capacity (+0x18,
   capacity +0x24) and a ring of pending sets (+0x28 capacity, +0x30 slots, +0x38 counter, its low 20 bits the count). A
   Bool entry is 0x18 bytes (+0x08 the reset kinds, +0x10 the save file, -1 none, +0x15 default, +0x16 current value), an
   Int or UInt entry 0x28 (+0x08, +0x10 the same, +0x18 default, +0x1c current). Structs group flags: the struct table
   (+0xc10 count, +0xc18 entries of 0x20, +0xc20 slots, +0xc2c capacity) maps a struct's hash to an entry whose member
   table (+0x08, capacity +0x14) holds {u32 member hash, u32 flag or struct hash} slots. Flags are named by MurmurHash3 of
   their names; the names stay out of this file, the hashes it needs are numbers below. Before anything is shared, the
   table is checked against the game's own getter (f_8022d9c0, as oot_gamedata_bool calls it): a build whose table reads
   otherwise shares nothing.

   Writes go through the game's own set routines, SetBool (f_806a2b20) and SetInt (f_80183b70), with x0 the manager, x1
   the value and x2 the hash: they queue the change on the ring, and the game's per-frame drain writes the current and
   saved values and its own bookkeeping, as for a change the game made. Never a direct write of the table (as
   oot_gamedata_set_bool does for the debug tools' age toggle): that would bypass the queue. Reads are of the entries'
   current values.

   What is shared (docs/coop.md has the reasons):
   - progress: every Bool that goes to progress.sav (save file 0) and is reset only by a new game or a load (reset kinds
     8, 16 and 32; flags with kind 1 or 256 revert at scene changes, 2 at a new day, 4 are options), except the songs,
     the first-get markers and the heart rewards below. Its register is 1 once the flag differs from its default (some
     start true and count down). Story, world and dungeon flags are one category: the game's flags carry no mark of which
     is which, and their names do not reach the runtime.
   - items: the item counts of the pouch struct (except the lists below), the capacity struct (wallet, bag and quiver
     sizes), the magic meter's size, and the first-get struct's markers; the highest count wins.
   - songs: 13 first-get markers. quest: 11 pouch counts (medallions, stones, the stone of agony, the gerudo card).
   - keys: the small-key count of each dungeon (the dungeon struct's member); rupees: the wallet's count; ammunition: 7
     pouch counts. These three are counters the game spends: shared, they are pools (coop_state.h), else per player.
   - per player always: the trade sequence, rented masks, the knife that breaks, amiibo items and one unknown seed item
     (a highest-count merge would hand back what the game took away); heart pieces and gold skulltula tokens, and the 11
     heart reward flags (their pickups are mostly per-object flags this layer does not write, so a shared count would
     pay a piece twice); life, the magic in the meter, bottle contents, equipment worn, the time of day, Link's place.

   Threads: the game's presenting thread reads and applies (hos_oot_coop_present), never waiting on the co-op thread (a
   frame in which the engine is busy reads nothing); the co-op thread (host/coop.c's hooks) carries the engine's
   messages, the offer, the acceptance and the copy of the save.

   Progress sync is on with co-op: from the first present when HOS_COOP=1 or coop=1 in the options file asks for it (as
   host/coop.c's session reads them), else from the session's first callback, when the Co-op tab switches co-op on
   later (sync_on). Other switches (read at the first present): HOS_COOP_PROGRESS, _ITEMS,
   _SONGS, _QUEST (shared|own), HOS_COOP_KEYS, _RUPEES, _AMMO (pool|own) the rules a room this game makes uses,
   HOS_COOP_ACCEPT=always (every room's offer accepted: tests; the environment only, hookshot_env.txt cannot set it),
   HOS_COOP_TRACE (a line per value sent, received and applied), and for tests HOS_COOP_PROBE=1 (with or without co-op:
   the table, its check against the getter and the gate logged; nothing written unless HOS_COOP_TEST_SET) and
   HOS_COOP_TEST_SET="hash=value@frame,..." (that flag set through the game's routine at that frame of play; the
   environment only). */
